# Pathifier Tool Kit
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/35399106.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/35399106)

This repository has been developed to help users to run Pathifier and visualize its results 
in an interactive manner. The code may need modifications according to user's needs.

Pathifier is an algorithm designed to model the heterogeneity in samples 
based on their genomic data, e.g. gene expression levels, in a pathway 
centered manner [(Drier et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1219651110). 
It does it by calculating the level of deregulation compared
to a control group taking into account all the genes involved in a specific
pathway. In this manner it is possible to represent samples with fewer, but
more informative variables, based on biological knowledge of the biomolecules
that work togheter in a pathway (e.g. apoptosis).

The following scripts may be used for easier loading of data, and calculation 
of default arguments not implemented in the native functions. As well as attractive
plotting of the results of the deregulation analysis.

### 1_Run_Pathifier.R

An R script for running Pathifier (Drier et al., 2013) in R.

First file required is TAB separated file of the gene expression matrix in the
following format:

|NAME|Sample1|Sample2|Sample3|Sample n...|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|NORMALS|1|1|0|...|
|Gene1|1.25|1.56|2.56|...|
|Gene2|4.56|0.25|1.75|...|
|Gene3|1.56|3.21|1.36|...|
|GeneN|...|...|...|...|

1st row = Sample names
2nd row = Normal status of samples: 1 = Healthy, 0 = Tumor
1st col = Gene names from third row on (Gene symbol format is recommended)

Second file required by the script is a TAB separated file of the pathway
information in GMT format:

|||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|PATHWAY1|Blank cell|GeneA|GeneB|GeneC|etc...|
|PATHWAY2|Blank cell|GeneD|GeneA|GeneX|etc...|

Notes:
+ NO HEADER ROW!
+ Gene names used must coincide between expression matrix and pathway annotation
+ GMT format: Each row represents a pathway. 1st column is pathway name or id, 
2nd column it's discarded BUT needed, from the 3rd column on starts the genes 
belonging to that pathway.
+ The PDS stability procedure is set to 10 for illustrative purposes (default should be 100), 

**Test-data is provided on TEST-DATA directory**

### 2_Heatmap_4_PDS.R

An R script for showing results of Pathifier (Drier et al., 2013)
in a heatmap, showing the deregulation of each sample by pathway.

This script works directly with the results of the "1_Run_Pathifier.R" script 
and the stand-alone version of Pathifier, adding a vector for depicting
normal samples (See additional notes).

The last update of the heatmap adds sample labeling for normal (healthy) vs 
tumoral samples

### 3_Curves_4_PDS.R

An R script with 2 functions for plotting the principal curves derived of the 
pathway deregulation analysis using Pathifier (Drier et al., 2013)

This script works directly with the results of "1_Run_Pathifier.R" script and
the stand-alone version of Pathifier, adding a vector for depicting normal 
samples (See additional notes).
